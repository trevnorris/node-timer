bench-timer
===========
### Create benchmarks for node

Use this to create extensive benchmarks for your libraries. Focus during
development has been to remove impact on your benchmarks and create an easily
extendable api for customization.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install bench-timer
```

Examples
--------

Currently all usage is in the head of `bench-timer.js`. This will change when I
find time to create proper documentation.
